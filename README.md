# Through the Ages Data Website



This project uses the data from [TTA Pulse](www.ttapulse.com) for analysis purpose. 



## How could you get these data?

The source code of  `pulse.py` shows the process to retrieve code from TTA Pulse website. Also, an RPA programme (using `pyautogui` to broswer game detail and simple image recognition algorithm to detect correct leaders and wonders) is developed by another teammate to gather detailed data for over 10000 games. 



## How to use this website?

Yet, CGE official has no willing for sharing big data from their database, for now it sounds better for me to keep the source data secretly. 

Still, Users can view the designed results through this website, from cards' win rate to players (occur on TTA Pulse platform) detailed statistics. 



## Furture Plan

### For User

* feel free to give any advice.


### For Dev Purpose

* split the main file to multiple sub files. 
* Performance Imporvment.
* More interaction for code/card selection.
